2. Redux Toolkit Shopping Cart
In this experiment:

A React app was enhanced with Redux Toolkit for global state management.

A cartSlice was created defining actions and reducers for adding, removing, and updating shopping cart items.

The React components were connected to the Redux store using useSelector to read state and useDispatch to update it.

This showcased modern, efficient state management practices enabling scalable and maintainable React applications.

The UI immediately reflects changes to cart state, demonstrating reactive and predictable application behavior.
