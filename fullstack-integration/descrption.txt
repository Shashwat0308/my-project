1. React and Express Integration Experiment
This experiment involved building a simple full-stack application where:

The backend is an Express API serving product data.

The frontend is a React app that uses Axios to fetch product data from the backend and display it.

The focus was on API integration, handling asynchronous data fetching, loading and error states.

The goal was to demonstrate fundamental client-server communication in a web application.
